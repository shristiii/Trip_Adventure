                    <p><b>Steps to follow before you plan for the EBC Trek
                      Choose the best time.</b></p>  <br>
                   <p align="justify">
                      While you plan a trek to Everest Base Camp, choosing the right weather and the best time is necessary. If you are trekking in the wrong seasons, the experiences you get may not live up to your mark. So choose the right time wisely.
                      
                      The best times for the EBC trek are March to May and September to November. During these months, the weather is clear and you get unobstructed views of the Himalayas.
                      
                      If you are planning an Everest Base Camp Trek in other months, enquire about the current weather and climatic conditions in the Himalayas with the Heaven Himalaya team before you decide.
                      <br>
                      Decide on a luxury trip or a budget tour.
                      Second, decide with your team whether you want a budget tour or a luxury trip to Everest Base Camp. A luxury trip includes staying in luxury five-star hotels in Kathmandu and other routes along the journey.
                      
                      Likewise, a normal budget tour includes three-star hotels in Kathmandu and the best guesthouses during trekking days.</p>

                    <h2>Pumdikot View Tower and Shiva Statue â€“ New Attractions in Pokhara</h2> <br>
                    <h4>March 6, 2022</h4> <br>
                    <h5>50 ft. Shiv Idol, Pumdikot Shiva Statue.</h5>
                    <div class="img"><img   src="pumdikot.jpg" width="50%" height="300"></div>
                    <p align="justify">Pumdikot Viewpoint is an additional tourist attraction in Pokhara, popular for its view tower and a huge Shiva statue. The new 3-story view tower lies just above the World Peace Pagoda in Pumdi Bhumdi VDC in Pokhara.
                       <br>
                      The viewpoint is a picturesque location at a height of 1500 m. Although the overall construction of a theme park has not been finished yet, the place has already attracted travelers as one of the popular hills stations in Nepal.
                      <br>
                      The hill station offers striking views of Phewa Lake, Pokhara city, para-gliding, Pame, Sarangkot, and other tourist destinations in Pokhara. Similarly, it also offers a magnificent view of the Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, and Machhapuchhre mountains.</p>
                      <br> <h4>Hiking to Pumdikot View Tower</h4> <br>
                    <p align="justify">Hiking in Nepal is a splendid choice to enjoy your holiday. The big Shiva statue and the Pumdikot view tower are about 13 km southwest of the primary market of Pokhara. If you are planning a hike in the area, you can start with an early morning hike to the World Peace Pagoda. You can choose from various ways, like hiking trails, blacktopped roads, and cycling trails, to get to the place. And after you reach the Peace Pagoda, either visit the Buddhist shrine or head uphill to Pumdikot Danda. The place is about 45 minutes uphill from the Peace Pagoda. The trails are pure and in a natural state. You can also get there using a vehicle, but the roads are quite uneasy and slippery. So, hiking is a good choice.
                       <br>
                    While you hike uphill from Pokhara, a wonderful view of Phewa Lake and nearby temples will follow you. As the hiking goes on, the views become clearer and wider. Similarly, the morning rays of the sun peeking through the majestic mountains like Annapurna, Machhapuchhre, and Dhaulagiri will cheer you up on your journey. As you reach the World Peace Pagoda, you will have a great angle view of Pokhara city and the lakes nearby.</p>
